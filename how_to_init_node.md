This txt will be your guide to initiate node js on your computer.

1. use command `npm init` to install node package
2. done

To install nodemon use `npm install nodemon`
To install express use `npm install express`
To install mongoose use `npm install mongoose`
To install morgan use `npm install morgan`
To install jsonwebtoken use `npm install jsonwebtoken`
(we use jsonwebtoken for authentication and authorization and stuff)
To install jsonwebtoken use `npm install bcryptjs`
(we use bcryptjs to encrypt the password)

Use `--no-save` or `--save-dev` option to temporally install the package and not include it to the dependencies list

This is done with the fact that you wouldn't include the package in the final product

Eg. nodemon is useful for development but not so on deployment. In fact, it is useless.
